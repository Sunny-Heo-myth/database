# p.a1 is either null or not.
# r1.a1 or r2.a1 are also either null or not.
# when there is null in predicate database exclude the case.
# So p.a1 and either r1.a1 or r2.a1 both should not be null.
# For the rest cases, if p.a1 = r1.a1 or p.a1 = r2.a1 the cartesian product record will appear as a record.
